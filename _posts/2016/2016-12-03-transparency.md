We are very proud to launch the first German litigation fund for freedom of information (FOI) today, called [Transparenzklagen.de](https://transparenzklagen.de/) ("Transparency Lawsuits"). Together with our partners from the [Society for Civil Rights](https://freiheitsrechte.org/index.php/english/), we want to help people claim their right to information in Germany more effectively. 

Last year, about 10.000 freedom of information requests were filed to German federal authorities. Yet only 11 FOI lawsuits againts federal authorities were successful. We will change that.

The litigation fund is open to anyone with a case already denied by German authorities and of strategical importantance. Users of the FOI platform FragDenStaat can apply directly on the website. The interface connects the documents obtained by the authorities with the litigation fund.

The fund is financed mainly by donations. Initial funding for the initiative comes from the "bridge Foundation".
