We are very proud to launch the first German litigation fund for freedom of information (FOI) today. It is called [Transparenzklagen.de](https://transparenzklagen.de/) ("Transparency Lawsuits"). Together with our partners from the [Society for Civil Rights](https://freiheitsrechte.org/index.php/english/) we want to support people to claim their right to information in Germany more effectively. 

Last year, about 10.000 freedom of information requests were filed to German Federal authorities. Still, only 11 FOI lawsuits againts Federal authorities were successful. We will change that. 

Everybody can apply for funding through the litigation fund as long as they present a case that is already denied by German authorities and is strategically important. Users of the FOI platform FragDenStaat can apply directly through the website. The interface connects the documents obtained by the authorities through the website with the litigation fund.

The fund is financed mainly by donations. Initial funding for the initiative comes from the bridge Foundation.
